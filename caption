🔍 Project Highlights:
1️⃣ Data Exploration & Insights
📌 Conducted EDA to analyze passenger demographics, ticket classes, and survival distribution.
📌 Used descriptive statistics, correlation heatmaps, and data visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
📌 Handled missing values in features like Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
📌 Encoded categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Embarked) for model compatibility.
📌 Scaled numerical features for better performance in predictive models.
3️⃣ Feature Engineering & Relationship Analysis
📌 Explored relationships between Survival and key features like Gender, Class, Age, and Fare.
📌 Created new features, such as family size, to enhance data insights.
📌 Identified the impact of passenger class and gender on survival rates.
4️⃣ Data Visualization & Insights
📌 Used histograms, bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps to analyze data distributions.
📌 Visualized survival rate differences across various groups (e.g., gender, class, age).
📌 Highlighted patterns and anomalies in the dataset.
